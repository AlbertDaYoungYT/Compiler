"The Deaconess of the Favonius Church       Every denizen of Mondstadt adores Barbara. However,
and a shining starlet adored by all."       she learned the word "idol" from a magazine.
Although the concept of a starlet is
rather novel in a city of bards, the
people of Mondstadt love Barbara
nonetheless.
"I owe everything to the city's spirit
of freedom." — Barbara, regarding her
popularity.

DESCRIPTION                                 INGAME DESCRIPTION
Captain of the Crux, with quite the         Captain of the Crux and its crew. She's quite an
reputation in Liyue.                        unbound and forthright woman.
There are those who say she can split
mountains and part the sea. Others say
she draws lightning through her sword.
Some say that even the mightiest of sea
beasts are no match for her.
For those not from Liyue, it may sound
like a hearty joke, but those that have
sailed with her will say — "No matter
what sea beasts there may be, Beidou
will be sure to split them all in two."

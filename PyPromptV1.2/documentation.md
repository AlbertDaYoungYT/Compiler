# PyPrompt V1.2
__This is the  of PyPrompt V1.2__

---

This program is Free and open-source you are free to make modules and give me ideas for updates. The program is also in early access and will be changed and modified. If you want an old version of the program you can always download old versions of PyPrompt on my Website. I will probably create a stable release of PyPrompt in 2021 and afterwards I will be creating modules and addons. In version 1.2 tpi doesn't work because I am focusing on commands but it will be fixed in 1.3.

The commands in PyPrompt are inspired by the node.js terminal and the command prompt from Windows. This is a detailed look on the commands because the help command doesn't have enough room for command help but will also probably be fixed in 1.3.
